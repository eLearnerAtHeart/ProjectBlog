                <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p lang=es>There is something special about making home-made meals and the work it takes to follow the
                    recipe step by step. There is beauty in the making process and the amount of ingredients. Besides
                    the health benefits, the waiting time can give you an adrenalin boost. I enjoy home made dish like
                    this <em>Pastelo de Platano Maduro,</em> translated to Sweet Plantain Casserole. The casserole
                    usually
                    includes ground meat, some veggies and cheese of your choices. The making process is usually quick
                    and consist of boiling the sweet plantains. Then, mashing them like mash potatoes with a little salt
                    and butter. You want to make sure to cook separately and season the ground meet of your preference
                    such as chicken, beef, or pork. Similar to a lasagna dish you want to layer it in an oven-safe
                    container or casserole dish. The layering order I normally like to follow is sweet plantain, meat
                    with mixed veggies and third mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering to your preference or container
                    capacity. Ensure everything its cooked prior to layering and top it with cheese for 15-25 mins. All
                    set and ready to enjoy.

            <article class="dancing">
                <h2>Dancing</h2>
                <p> Dancing for me its a form of relaxation and stress release. My every being moves to the sound of the
                    music. Coming from a Caribbean-Dominican Republic background where we are known traditionally for
                    <em>bachata, merengue and salsa,</em> my body moves naturally. My body and soul move to the rhythm
                    of the
                    beat as a form of expressing authenticity. I grew up in a culture where dancing was a norm for
                    social gathering and socializing. Its something people picks up as you grow-up in the “barrios”
                    (neighborhood) of the city or country-side.There was no teacher nor personal trainers. Your body
                    learned with constant practice and observation. My experience with Jazz was something completely
                    different. It was like learning a new language where you have to keep track of every move from leg
                    rises, turns and spin. It requires more work beyond dance count and a thorough understanding of each
                    movement. The final product felt like a theatrical scene.

                <h2>Biking</h2>
                <p>
                    Biking is a form of workout and it turns out to be a little more. My mind travels at a 100 mile at
                    the simple act of moving the pedals and directing my gear. The history with this bike is quiet
                    especial since it was gifted. I called it at the right time and place. There is beauty in second
                    hand items. It makes you question did this bike have a positive life span with the previous owner?
                    How much sweat did they put into their workout and did they give the bike the proper care? Like
                    everything in life a well maintained bike can safe you money and expand its life expectancy. Every
                    ride its a new experience.

                <h2>H<sub>2</sub>O</h2>
                <p> Water is life and there is nothing more I enjoy than to sit by the beach. I like to hear the sound
                    of the waves while watching the sunrise or sunset. I tend to release my stress and all the bagged
                    out to the sea. Reflecting on my day and evaluating how I can always be a better me. The ocean has
                    its way of healing any hardship and somehow tends to do deep cleaning on my mind and soul. I also
                    enjoy swimming or just seating by the edges of the beach as the wave pull and push. I have learned
                    that the ocean has a life of its own since all different kind of creatures live under. At the beach
                    its more common to find jellyfish, crabs and some fishing depending on the area. I once stepped in
                    one of those mysteries whole and panic. This taught me that the ocean can only be trusted to a
                    certain extend.

            <article class="selfCare">
                <h2>Self Care</h2>
                <p>There is plenty of self care tools from beauty products to hand on work. It can be tricky to know
                    which one to chose. I enjoy journaling from time to time. I also enjoy reading self health books.
                    Taking care does not have to consist of physical things but the things that we consume mentally.
                    It’s a form of loving ourself and practicing an act of kindness.

            <article class="games">

                <h2>Games</h2>
                <p>I love board games and one that is especial to me is monopoly card. It brings out all different
                    personality or character out of people. It’s different from the board game and the most modern
                    version since it consist of cards. Fun to play since you can play it with 5 player for like 15 mins
                    each game. I also enjoy chess and there is nothing like a mind challenge. Both games consist of
                    strategizing and practicing critical thinking.
